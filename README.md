# Machine Learning, a quick guide

Here is everything I consider useful to apply machine learning on the verge of knowing whats happening inside your network.

I'm using The HundredPage Machine Learning Book by Andriy Burkov (already a summary) as reference, so this guide is kinda summary of a summary. Do not take it as a scientific reference, just for learning.

# How to read this

Block quotes will be used to give some optional deepining about some matter, for example:

> This is an optional deeping or trivial that I consider important to create an intuition.
> You can ignore it if you want as everything on the post, but this one I'm asserting you can set aside without any guilty.

(Expand later)

# Introduction

## What is machine learning

A subfield of computer science that relies on creating algorithms that uses a given sample to optime its output, by "**learning**" accordly, read learning as optimatizing its internal parameters, on a elementary neural network for example those parameters are the neurons cells.
